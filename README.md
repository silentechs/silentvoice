This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file (or use your hosting provider env settings).

- **Database**
  - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
- **App**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` in dev, your real domain in prod)
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL` (where moderation notifications go)
  - `MODERATION_SECRET` (used to sign one-click approve/reject links)
- **Email (Resend)**
  - `RESEND_API_KEY`
  - `RESEND_FROM` (or `FROM_EMAIL`) (e.g. `Silent Voice Sanctuary <no-reply@yourdomain.com>`)
- **Cloudflare R2 (uploads)**
  - `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`
  - `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
  - `R2_PUBLIC_URL` (or `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Debugging "Why do I see poems when I think the DB is empty?"

In development, you can verify which DB the app is connected to and whether it contains poems:

- `GET /api/debug/db`
  - Shows a **DATABASE_URL fingerprint** (never the URL itself)
  - Shows row counts (e.g. `poemsTotal`, `poemsApproved`)

If you see poems when you expected none, the counts above will confirm whether you’re connected to a different DB than you thought.

### Clearing the DB (development only)

To delete **all poems** and **all non-owner users** (keeps the owner account):

```bash
CONFIRM_DB_CLEAR=YES APP_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run db:clear
```
